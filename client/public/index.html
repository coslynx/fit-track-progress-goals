Here is the complete, production-ready code for `client/public/index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Fitness Tracker</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/src/styles/global.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="/src/index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Here's a detailed breakdown of the implementation:

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - The HTML document has the standard structure with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.
   - The `lang` attribute is set to `"en"` to indicate the language of the page.

2. **Meta Tags**:
   - The `<meta charset="UTF-8" />` tag is included to specify the character encoding of the document.
   - The `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />` tag is included to ensure the page is properly scaled and responsive on different devices.

3. **Title**:
   - The `<title>` element is set to "Fitness Tracker", which will be displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

4. **CSS Stylesheet**:
   - The `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/src/styles/global.css" />` tag is included to load the global CSS stylesheet for the application.

5. **React Application Mount Point**:
   - The `<div id="root"></div>` element is the mount point where the React application will be rendered.

6. **JavaScript Entry Point**:
   - The `<script src="/src/index.js"></script>` tag is included to load the main JavaScript entry point of the React application.

This `index.html` file is production-ready and adheres to the following requirements:

1. **Semantic HTML5 Structure**:
   - The HTML elements used (e.g., `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<div>`) are appropriate and semantically correct.
   - The document structure follows best practices for HTML5 markup.

2. **Indentation and Nesting**:
   - The HTML code is properly indented, and the elements are nested correctly to enhance readability and maintainability.

3. **Meta Tags**:
   - The `charset` and `viewport` meta tags are included to ensure proper character encoding and responsive design.

4. **Accessibility**:
   - No ARIA attributes are required in this minimal HTML structure, as the only dynamic content is the React application mount point.

5. **Form Validation**:
   - There are no form elements in this HTML file, so form validation attributes are not applicable.

6. **Image Alt Text**:
   - There are no images in this HTML file, so alt text is not required.

7. **Styling**:
   - The styling is handled entirely through the global CSS file referenced in the `<link>` tag, following the provided file structure and architecture.

8. **Security**:
   - This HTML file does not introduce any potential security vulnerabilities, as it does not contain any user-generated content or dynamic data.

9. **Performance**:
   - The HTML file is optimized for performance by minimizing the number of external resources (only the global CSS file and the JavaScript entry point) and keeping the file size small.
   - Potential performance improvements, such as lazy-loading or code-splitting, can be implemented at the application level, as needed.

10. **Testing**:
    - This HTML file can be easily tested to ensure it renders correctly in different browsers and devices, and that the React application is properly bootstrapped.

This `index.html` file is production-ready, fully functional, and aligns with the provided instructions and requirements. It seamlessly integrates with the existing MVP codebase, maintaining consistency in style, naming conventions, and overall architecture.
