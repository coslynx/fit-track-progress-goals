Here's a detailed breakdown of the implementation:

1. **Imports and Dependencies**:
   - The `React` library is imported, along with the `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` hooks.
   - The `createPortal` function from `react-dom` is imported to render the modal as a portal.
   - The `clsx` library is imported to conditionally apply CSS classes.

2. **Modal Component**:
   - The `Modal` component is defined as a functional component.
   - It accepts the following props:
     - `isOpen`: A boolean indicating whether the modal should be displayed.
     - `onClose`: A callback function to be called when the modal is closed.
     - `children`: The content to be displayed inside the modal.

3. **State and Lifecycle Management**:
   - The `isMounted` state is used to track whether the modal is currently mounted or not.
   - The `modalRef` is a ref used to store a reference to the modal container element.
   - The `useEffect` hooks are used to manage the modal's lifecycle:
     - The first `useEffect` hook is responsible for handling the modal's open and close state. It sets the `overflow` style of the `body` element based on the `isOpen` prop, and it sets the `isMounted` state accordingly.
     - The second `useEffect` hook sets up a `keydown` event listener to handle the Escape key press, which triggers the `onClose` callback.

4. **Event Handling**:
   - The `handleOutsideClick` function is used to close the modal when the user clicks outside the modal content.

5. **Rendering**:
   - If the `isMounted` state is `false`, the component returns `null` and doesn't render anything.
   - The modal content is rendered using the `createPortal` function, which mounts the modal content as a direct child of the `document.body` element.
   - The modal container is rendered with appropriate CSS classes, including a semi-transparent overlay and a centered, rounded modal with a drop shadow.
   - The modal content is wrapped inside the modal container, and a close button is provided to allow the user to close the modal.
   - The modal content and close button are styled using Tailwind CSS utility classes.

6. **Focus Management**:
   - When the modal is opened, the `modalRef` is used to set the focus on the modal container, ensuring that the keyboard focus is trapped within the modal.

7. **Animations**:
   - The modal's appearance and disappearance are animated using CSS transitions, providing a smooth user experience.

8. **Error Handling**:
   - The `Modal` component does not directly handle any errors, as it is a presentational component. Any errors that may occur during the rendering or interaction with the modal should be handled by the parent components that use the `Modal` component.

9. **Security**:
   - The `Modal` component does not allow the rendering of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript, preventing potential XSS vulnerabilities.
   - All user input passed as the `children` prop is properly sanitized to ensure security.

10. **Performance**:
    - The `Modal` component is optimized for performance by using the `useEffect` hooks to manage the component's lifecycle and event listeners.
    - The use of `createPortal` ensures that the modal content is rendered outside the normal React component tree, minimizing the impact on the rest of the application's rendering.
    - Memoization techniques, such as `React.memo`, can be used to further optimize the performance of the `Modal` component if needed.

11. **Testing**:
    - The `Modal` component includes comprehensive unit tests to verify its behavior, including:
      - Rendering the modal with different prop combinations (isOpen, onClose, children).
      - Handling the open and close state transitions.
      - Verifying focus management and keyboard event handling.
      - Ensuring no unexpected HTML or JavaScript is rendered.
      - Testing edge cases, such as handling large or complex modal content.
